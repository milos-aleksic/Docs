# Installation

Installing the **DownloadPro** element is very easy:

1. Download **DownloadPro** package from https://www.zoolanders.com/extensions/download-pro.
2. Go to the Joomla Extension Manager (*Joomla Administration / Extensions / Extension Manager / Extension Manager: Install*).
3. Upload the previously downloaded **DownloadPro** package.
4. Click "Install" and wait until the installation process will be finished.

After this, the **DownloadPro** plugin should be installed and published. To be sure, go to ***Extensions / Plugin Manager*** and check if **ZLElements** is present and enabled.

### Quick Note
**DownloadPro** is installed under the same plugin, ZLElements, as any other ZL Element for performance reasons. If you want to check that **DownloadPro** is installed correctly, visit the ZOO configuration and edit a type.
To do this: 
- Click "gear" tab.
- Click the "Edit Elements" link under any type name. 

If **DownloadPro** shows up on the right section, then you're good to go!
