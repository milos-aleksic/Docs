##Isn't there ANY better way to Import / Export

Unfortunately, there isn't presently any better solution for importing/exporting data into/out of ZOO. However, we've heard your requests and experienced this limitation ourselves. We've got it on our wishlist for a solution at some point in the future.

Our ideal solution, like our ZOO elements will allow you to import/export without requiring you to 'hack' the core ZOO (or Joomla) code.
