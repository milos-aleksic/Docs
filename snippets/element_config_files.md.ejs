- **Mode**. 
You have three selections here: *Files, Folders, Both*.
	- **Files**: You can select ***just*** files from your disk (and upload them), one by one.
	- **Folders**: You can select ***just*** folders (but you can still upload files into the folders), one by one. The system will fetch the files contained in that folder automatically.
	- **Both**: You can select ***both*** files and folders (and still upload files). The system will merge the files from the folders and the files you selected in a single list.

- **Default Source**.
Default file for download. If no source is specified in the Item, the *specified default will be used on rendering*. Can be a full path to a *Folder or File*. 
If you input **[authorname]** in the path, it will be replaced with the item's author name.

- **Legal Extensions**.
This allows you to limit the extensions of files to those, indicated here. The default (bmp|gif|jgp|jpeg|png) will only allow files with these extensions to be uploaded. You can add, remove or replace this list if needed. Separate multiple file extensions with a 'pipe' `|` character (no spaces).

- **File Directory Path**.
Relative path to file directory. Defaults to the standard 'images' folder of Joomla or Media Manager Files Folder Path value if left blank, started with variable or Joomla prohibited folder and no External Integration set.
