#Installation

## Through Joomla Manager

1. Download **<%= title %>** package from https://www.zoolanders.com/<%= link %>.
<%
var apps = apps == undefined ? null : apps;
if (apps) { 
%>
1. Unpack the package and find the ZOO Apps installers.
1. Go to the **ZOO App Manager** (*Joomla Administration / Components / ZOO / Gearwheel*).
<% } %>
1. Install the previously unpacked App/s. If you are not familiar with this process please review the [official ZOO docs](http://www.yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/getting-started/install-a-new-app).
1. Go to the **Joomla Extension Manager** (*Joomla Administration / Extensions / Extension Manager / Install*).
1. Use the "Upload Package File" option to choose the previously downloaded package from your pc.
1. Click on the "Upload & Install" button.

<% if (package.plugin) { %>
   Once the installation process have finished the **<%= package.plugin %>** plugin should be installed and published. To be sure go to *Joomla Administration / Extensions / Plugin Manager* and check if it is present and enabled.
<% } %>

**Note**: When you are facing an error during installation, it is highly recommended to try to Install from directory:

1. Unpack all files from the **<%= title %>** downloaded package to a directory on your pc.
2. Using FTP, upload this directory to the /tmp directory of your Joomla installation on your webserver.
2. Go to the **Joomla Extension Manager** (*Joomla Administration / Extensions / Extension Manager / Install*).
3. Use the "Install from Directory" option to set the directory of your uploaded package files.
4. Click on the "Install" button and Joomla will install it from the given directory.

<% if (package.plugin === 'ZL Elements') {
	var el = {}; 
	var elements = elements == undefined ? [title] : elements;
	el.group_text = elements.join(' & ');
	el.text = elements.length > 1 ? 'elements are' : 'element is';
%>
### Quick Note
**<%= title %>** <%= el.text %> installed under the same plugin, *ZL Elements*, as any other ZL Element for performance reasons. If you want to check it's installation, visit the ZOO configuration and edit any Type from any App. If **<%= el.group_text %>** shows up on the right section under *ZOOlanders* Group, then you're good to go!
<% } %>

## Trough ZL Manager

2. Open the Component (Components / ZOOlanders Manager).

5. Be patient while the Installation proceeds, the page will be refreshed once done.
